Most Vietnamese people practice their ''tin nguong'' chiefly through worshiping with home altars, or going to Buddhist temples wishing for good luck on Lunar New Year, etc., and at the same time they may still not identify with any specific religion (even Buddhism itself) because they may be doing those things in their own ways or customs (for example, doing every two years, or only in years projected as particularly unlucky for one's zodiac sign), rather than according to a strict religious guideline or doctrine.|

tu lay|noun|:* Any monosyllabic word can derive a ''tu lay'' formation by appending the rhyme ''iec'' to the onset of that word for a second syllable. However, some words may preferably not be ''lay''-ed, but rather, derive compounds based on homonyms to denote a sense of downplaying or dismissal that ''iec'' does. For example, when replying to sao (what), one may use {{m|vi
tu lay|Sao trang gi?|The hell do ya meanwhat"?}} which consists of sao (star), the homonym in question, and trang (moon), a coordinated concept, to reinforce the same effect that *''sao siec'' would. Others, such as hay, would be replied to with set ''tu lay'' of their own, such as hay ho or hay hom, rather than *''hay hiec''.|* Some words, especially those for colors, can derive a ''tu lay'' formation, a softened or uncertain version of themselves, by putting the ngang tone on the first syllable if they carry a trac tone (i.e. neither the ngang or huyen tones) (e.g. {{m|vi|trang|trang trang|whitish}}; {{m|vi|do|do do|reddish}}; {{m|vi|tim|tim tim|purplish}}; {{m|vi|dang|dang dang|a bit bitter}}). Those with a bang tone simply do so by reduplicating themselves (e.g. {{m|vi|den|den den|blackish}}; {{m|vi|xanh|xanh xanh|gruish}}; {{m|vi|hay|hay hay|kind of interesting}}; {{m|vi|so|so so|barely}}). Words with the nang tone (a ''trac'' tone), on the other hand, typically use the ''huyen'' tone instead, e.g. {{m|vi|ngo|ngo ngo|kind of funny}}; {{m|vi|la|la la|kind of weird}}; {{m|vi
